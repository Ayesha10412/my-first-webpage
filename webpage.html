        <p id="new">A webpage, or web page, is a document composed using a markup language like HTML so that web browsers can read it. Webpages have distinct features, text, and URLs so people can access them directly. You can create web pages using website builders like Wix or independently building them with HTML.</p>

    A web page is a document on the Web that is accessed in a web browser. A website typically consists of many web pages linked together under a common domain name. The term "web page" is thus a metaphor of paper pages bound together into a book.
